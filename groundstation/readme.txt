Welcome to the ARISS Radio Pi!

We hope you have fun learning about radio, the International Space Station, and Satellites! 

Make sure your RTL-SDR USB radio dongle is plugged into your Pi with an antenna connected.

Here's what you can do with your Radio Pi:

1. Listen to the radio on a web browser using the Web SDR (just click on the Web SDR icon)

2. Listen to FM Broadcast radio on your Pi (just click on the SDR FM Broadcast icon.  When it loads, click on the Generic RTL2838U device and click on Start).

3. Track the ISS and amateur radio satellites as they orbit the earth (just click on the Gpredict Track ISS & Sats icon.  Don't forget to set your home location under Edit/Preferences/Ground Stations)

4. Receive and decode AMSAT CubeSat telemetry (just click on the FoxTelem Satellite Telemetry icon. To track the AMSAT Fox satellites when they pass over, check the Auto Start box)

5. Use SDR# on your PC to listen to the radio (just click on the RTL-TCP SDR# on PC icon and make sure your PC is on the same WiFi network as your Pi)

Good luck!
